## Reflection: readingTracker.js Review

### What was the most helpful aspect of this codeâ€™s structure?
The most helpful part was how the functions were separated clearly and did only one job each. It made it easier to follow and understand what was happening without getting overwhelmed. The function names also matched what they were doing, which helped me figure things out faster.

### What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
It took me a little time to understand how the `mostReadBook` function worked, especially the part with counting books using an object. I had to slow down and trace the loop to see how it tracked which book appeared the most.

In general, reviewing this file helped me get better at reading real code and understanding how arrays and objects can work together.
